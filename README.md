# Final-proj-1810
final project for this class

Note, all of this is subject to change based on difficluty.
I plan to make a simple fighting game with a few monsters in it to fight.
For the styling, I am planing to have borders around the character and monster that they are fighting.
For fighting, I plan to have a basic just attack every second then have them attack each until one is dead.
there could be multiple types of equipment that has to do with drag and drop.
question about the static site generator in c# that sounds like blazor.  Clarify becuase blazor is technically meeting those requirements and that need to have things to be interisting.
Host the site on github? would that mean just make it public?
as for vercel, the tutorial I looked at is saying use github to do similiar things.
filter bar could be for the weaponry.
network to 
https://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/ what I want to find this api can work to give me the monsters information.


first week 
is the html
css atleast most of it.
and then input verification.
and possibly rendering the monsters information 
and getting it into the page with api calls.

week two is .
search for monsters and thorugh your weapons.
and local storage for weapons.
filter bar.

week three
I plan to use drag and drop for my weapon equiment and have that be 10 points under the hard things.
and then hosting my web site on the other pages.
then maybe making my 1410 final porject have an api part.  that might be what I do for bonus points.
