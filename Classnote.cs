some export functions the normal
curly brakets
and log its return UI.js lets console log yhe get messages
and then calll with parenthesis
it is tje anything error when it says cores
c# crashed and something else
we talked to the API it is something else
the string itself is not js notation return an object for c# API don't return straight up/
dynamic things are bad bur in this case it is the js syntaxe if the same it is a dynamic thing 
restart it.
should be brought in with javascripts
network and you click on it you will have to 
just had a weild filter and more dynamic things to do and get it to work.
wrap in currly brackects response.content but in this case wrap it in an object 
shows how things work and one of things is the paymend aplication external API that
he found is now in text but link to complicated it had such and has works slider layer with javascript and good animation
and have things working
comclusion was challenge H elarned a lot form it.

the rest are over your codesharing 
screen 
write down notes and why form and how ti works
and including things form text had all the cool stuff on it and such.
body and footer and how things work
esspecially of mindset of make it this or that yet
actually focusing on it it does it.
moving the screen around and thatn
styling was scrolable and les bos and hove and transition effects were nice
js was interisting
working with querry string was whatt is goiong on.
saes and loads in interisting way but a points
querry string is their from one to the next and pull it latter one
select option is shipping Price and manipulation it and shiping method and update price
basic skill was multiple languages
what makes it good and what this is their to od.
and then thie thing like background
understading of js
obsticles and all sorts of things and new languages
and projects was how to do it.
in the one UI for multiple pagese to stop complaining was list wouldn't save from one to the next querry string to fix that.
now go to website and how it works.
obviously thigns in cart to local storage due to purchase and author page is interistign nth child show that off here and how it works.
pulled up rubric on phone and how it works.
nth chiled
going through things and showing it nifty and guthib pages to load things in.
every thing in with and how ti works
mobile responsive was all right.
show 
show html was most how usernames creation just placing things for holders and how it works html 
going over things two much and all the good stuff and html hidden and absolut and have class and html organize with it
try for centered popup with z-index but such and covers  things up was fun for him
custom colors was nth child and server serch and not that much
servers schoolable evenly and javascirp was the API then recieves it for every thigns just give id to row and collum to send that to C# api
checkers on clicks with drag and drop
to send it that to send two numbers and made it work
to create custum record and it worked.
and website to have fun
nth child comes in and such
and incorperate things into web dev poject and API stuff latter on and cable and how much is hard coded and highscore system is hard coded and such.
jsut not add up how you wanted
rugh time management and happy with how things worked with event listeners and incorperated
and how it worked
white space for readbility to have under join and how it works
class content in passing
add elements
struggleing things to guthib pages down here and over all how we start it working
with that press buttons to over here which is presentec here is not element of 
strings working better
and come up tand have thigns which would have worked and unknown reason and such.
filtering
and other issue is value is event to keystroke is not on submit and storing information
wired out to js just right
differnet boards and stored in scrollable and hwo thinws work
repsersenting lists and how things work and collectedd to an API earlier
c;ocl events unplayable
domain and client for the lobby and sections He wasn't able to do it was a 
lot more dom baised and domain is interiting
currently and not being used due to harsh effect on the program
date an nth child and such
sign in and such
create event
two datea and selectors and go over how it works in thier.
event listed on row it is
colors are wield on projector and collors are wield on selector 
evnets are easy transition and sicn in to things
date from user in different formats is nucents
dynamic pages is in pages if you sign in and extra time commitment and how ti works
find it and how it works
then seed like form this day for what ever reson and da
if make usr it is added is added in inseritings
stay in the tow thei r one and jsut about every things cleared 
some of the css that he is proud of is interistign ad fixing that was nice adn such choose things to die on projector
spacer class to every thing
beore the actual search thing was in and character creation form was iteristing
liked the inititive traker as well
sving loading and dleting data is interisting
API ans stuff over html and catagory
natural stuff flexbox was built up over that.
stass and it stays cleared and such.
search with classes and all that 
not all had the description tag
doesn't have the same tags for all things 
about the project and where you got all of the audio on and hwo ti works.
thats how he got the icon to work. its going to show up wih things
to do it and how ti works
different sizes powercel text over images was challenging and html was interisting
icons and click something to do and click it and in a minute was not included
hardest part was interisting
and right here he has stuff that is in react and sass and bootstrap and here is the loading thing to do it with trying to show that as a react thing to do it
code time and thing that ode s tilabel them and such.
also their is more thingsshow it their and drop right thie  to dlelte every thing nad also have things to change eventually that was hard to do the css and up it over thier
tchoose things to uplaod and uplaod and size ones that would givet number seven is going to show right their
loading in the moment to se it and dodn't finish that part
onsplage and all the local and other htings
to the react fram work and mizing things that working in it
talking about how ti works
show how it works
framework is interisting and organizing things that are interisting
and inthis order was interisting and a lot of error do to other thigns
using js and framework and how they work incompatible and different but easy for you to write it.
displaying things on a page adn intercolations
was hard it deletes the image that was still their then having thankyou


second to lasts adn how it works
css and other things he was proud of and not too crazy and also the logging 
java scripted -- draker and boring put some livelyness in your steppto have things to have a bye next dive will display how it works
theres array functions and works good and works pretty good and scince same thing iwth the exection of mone page it is different
did tough to store jsons to format them right and getting them right was hard but annoying and removing it completely with trouble and such.
debuggers are hard and cool and log as much compared to other things
did it but deleted it due to bugs
and how that works
run through it really quik and rest from just ones to play around with.
keey frams and animation and runs through it.
all right i is un wieghted and such and how ti works
didn't get to and how it works
not stled on paswerd and how it works
all stored on the back end and registration and some selects for things in utah andtean nice then select the things you want and it will be their.
shearch for any things to hav show up.

thomas what is next
OpenMeteo UI with a weather app and how it works with displaying the weather at any city in the us
or locations at general
easy way it works with interisting thigns were the golabl color scheek
used to have varibles form out the css file
html for search over lay and how it works an schroolable div adn how it woks
having a second div to show up,
also the nav bar at every page o link to homw form each of the home page
take the current to have it applyed to the api and have it applied to it and forward casts this time ofyear
check for dad if no.
then sees if Multiple APIS at a time in the same project and such. learn a lot through that with search bars and had toruble was interisting is not a good time.
over to code on vercel and gut hib pages and how ti works
and how ti loooks form up at the top and how to do it
how to go home and persist that and have it stay
form is inthat hover and padding on things tha might or might not work and haw it works with current code and what is does
in thier it si set params in quick chart API and intheir is how he filters it with the things to get hurt
also in their it was not create new elements in it with async and await to do it.
and how ti helps
