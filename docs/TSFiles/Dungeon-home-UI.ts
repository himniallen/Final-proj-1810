/* reset can be easy if your paranoid about your distinctions.
poeple can change the schedule. then whatever they have done right now.
we have some sort of a current schedule.
to dimentional array in the domain.
is update and rerender it
so in your UI function you have  something like
just asks domain for a copie of it.
by workflow to some generated and then set to current schedule varible saying move this to that
reset we will rerun the generation and rearagned from scratch to do it from current schedule.
organize them to what you are attempting.
and edit it to have an issue form the master coppy from being the default but is collection but the 
the array of arrays that are empty
starting in the UI we call reset and render in your reset button log things.
going through and having things work to have it go and work.
 that might help fix it is to have the things be seperated things to have 
 this is interisting.
 how can we adjust this to be better for mobile.
 copies of the initial array without the contends
 commented out things such as master and did it again to see what happens with the second filter f
 foreach to remove and
 unassigned and classes were both referencing the same array becuase they were almost always by reference
    export the things to do it better for you. this is a function that will get the things to work and into a 
    second varible and go into service you did a reassignment.
    returns the api list and abouve it and no fetches is running on initilize.
    copy the linse to have interisting things
    list of classes.
    length of 0 is interisting in how it works and how the log works but it can be expanded and length of 0

    we just stoped having the get list
    and just log them inividually.
    goes to console.log e
    function to assign new things
    and how we have office hours things is interisting.
    office hours becuase have to continue and dive into it
    bonus points if we have the things to be done to have the proposals and uh go through how they work.
    meet dead lines saturday you will die.
    chess with chess api and when you have the things functionally and logic of what goes through to make sure that it is as hard until then
    make sure that things work and ajusted them from before.
    maybe have things mobile responsive to have extra credit before that there is an extra credit thing.
    go from their.
    filter based on what you have and possibly what you have.
    building our own API. make sure that it is a good thing on each page.
    so what we wants to implement is the clothes that we have and how to do it.
    do a day were we do this intergrations.
    integrating is much safe from legal perspective and pick a service that will do it later.
    and then later do your own later.
    such as things that is a concept and have different pages to host it that we will use blazor and have a c# API that can port over
    and have it fall under different things that is running without user interaction.
    series of websites that just run and don't work.
    so be less of a disconnect and have it do what we want to do that is do this thing do with fetch and invoke things to do backend API stuff.
    rugh timeline and have it labed and have things to be up to date.
    reality not what was proposed the thing.
    to get things with weather api todays and then weeks and maybe next two weeks.
    try to use browser locatoin api that gets data.
    on text and have the gps is worth hard things and one thing that is interisting
    granularity of things and like to see one more thing and stor in local things.
    but have them look at things that are stored and such.
    recamendation of locations and things.
    wouldn't have to do that.
    hosting things and other service that you have made. multiple lobies and life cycle.
    logic in c# is plenty of work is that it
    that is the big difficulty there.
    not inpossible but deffinatly hard.
    we should know this before moble and could lot of data to manage but things to upload and have a class day
    few things to teach but down to make things to do files external
    go over how to go over things to do it in his schedule and how to fix it.

    web site for authors that advertise to them and then have them show cased and have them work with portoflio
    demonstration to do it.
    one page to have drag and drop that were saying is to have the things form the website to have the books to store and add new books.
    something like that.
    like it portfolio sites ard cool.
    basicly make a hub for the tournament and all sorts of things.
    teams of three and how things work to have it five pages and information and information is a new thing 
    page for team 
    and how to have ADmin rules and how it works.
    integrated with chess.coms api for the things to have in the form or have the intergration and go for it
    haven't worked with before and you need to be start 
    tool chain and double checking and try to have it wrok.
    have an easier one to have themwork and day one is easier to work with and have something else in it.
    just get into the vanilia version
    what is he thinking 
    dnd character manager is interistnig.
    thing is that they have what supports it first is explosion of atributes to have these parts to focus on.

    with fifteen minutes left would re recamend typescript to 
    you just have to run the commands to go in when you get the things to ingnor ethings to domain 
    that is interisting and it needs to just create how it will make the js files inline.
    put the js files in folder and then inport them
    compile ts to js
    before the page reload
    sound have used the this keyword.
    ok private and public data and go object oriented more distinction and how things work
    return stirngs things and return a list of course objects
    how you use it is how to do it.
    day on typescript.
    see if you can fit it in and couple days on APIS next week.
    go ahead and get started on tuesday.
    
   Notes 4/11/2-24

  sometimes easier to have different things that work and have colapsing and side wide class and you go transisiton is this and outise - small 
  us to have js work it for you. have it wait a second and slide out and update
  um mayber have things to start and tweak and fine tune it.
  make it open all the time unless you expect a lot of points what is the most critical parts and such.
  contents is interisting
  
   Jidapa Angustti's ideas for me

   get to every body is going to present thi thing to make elements adn create the.
   had code is interisting
      then you have the plugging in and thus having core to what do you build then vs now.
      less work but still inportant to learn in school
      db processing scripts and someone else would give the sql is interisting
      job that does nothing and it crashed every thing else and 
      then once had the script but that was it.
      web browser
      code review and it laptop it took 40 out of 50 minutes to buffer
      thought was to see what books are shown instead of things that are different password auth and such.
      thus leaving to admin
      how to see if user is admin.
      through some suchjusttions.
      domian boolean admin is user.
      this is first getting it to work
      pasword in js on submit is valid correct password 
      bool comes true am I an admin is render the checkbox as well.
      not admin no controls
      check local storage is preset
      users have a guid of admin and role: admin
      book: 
      [
      
         {

         }
      ]

      api needs to support any one on any page is only one user is logged in
      I would have a dictionary key is Like a guid
      Id is front end on local storage
      does cureent id in storatage is usersesion object and goes in to come back.
      null id and start form logged in session.
      anad API knows who are you.
      Minimal amount but ref to API to look it up.
      pagenation costs API one cent for each item that it loads
      they say we give you ten at a time
      performance things is interhisting.
      ts day is soon.
      Having things be stored on API.
      main purpose is food and study at same time online vs instory.
      so Has main page not ready and some features their.
      whats available and else
      have all the photos that you need and basic fetures their.
      60-80 percent is interisting and have it done this week and thursday go over the hard stuck on.
      by end of week have things set up with data pipeline and such.
      post requests and more the same after this week.
      book orders vs armor orders public accessabule and have stuff ready for tues and thrusday.
      good amout that is done and nearly ready.
      cover images and to this
      rasterize image is try to show on screen to not have enough to ahve things do it 
      maybe four wide but screen is 3.
      is one for finding true color is the term pixel interpolation
      subsampleing is the step to get hteir.
      any ways math algorithing is interisting.
      would not be incorrects
      starting to see the more blury look due to sub sampleing and compression is artifact of when make show the pixel to image.
      run into a couple of times looks low quality to show smaller images then website.
      then you have it going to be interpolated to ahve interisting and such
      another thing is rgb is interisting.  Usually in RGB other ways
      CMYK is because it is interisting not realy for web dev
      rgb is in web  for our screen pizels ot look how we what it to look.
      have in with those collors vs rgb medium outputs in htos collors.
      non rasterized vector inages 
      vector images are in vectors used to make things not grids math algor to make vector images
      to basicly a math equation.
      open source is possible from before and even persistant svg is vector file format and is easy to work wiht.
      go to download file going to cat is interisthing
      got some schema and graphic an d buch of cords and draw lines to cords.
      strock and interisting.
      is math equation you can zoom in infinately and never find pixel lines and nevr get that going on and recompute to that size.
      put in rasterized bad but svg is 
      if page is loading thing to do individually do that latter go to stopper.
      API to Azure have the API
      might be tricky latter
      what did he do last year?  
      you can he wants us to save that for latter
      when we can use them more and for better.
      this is the thing access ot have you accessed it for studnet benefits 
      make an epmty c# API might as well use the final project
      go to app services and create a web app with a subscription availible 
      the free stuff ten for free until things load
      go to things such as gmail and half and half if working on account stuff
      your here for those with acounts 
      once those settings made it would preview and create
      .net 8 free teir select linux for it to work
      will take a little bit.
      at this point both of them won't work.
      over here we will
      go to somewhere and such and so forth
      with acceptances
      put them on the primeun teir not free becuas greedy barbarians
      ok we got page issues
      go home to appservices click things deployment Center is 
      after selecting your proj.
      after save up top due to having it not really working
      click on your thing 
      link it up with default doamin will show up to over view take a long time to load
      is that how it works and such.
      identity and create new with save uptop.
      yep signing in to github is for.
      things aren't trusted as much.
      passes on the point for account trouble that he agrees with.
      run from the root of your project propably build becuase all is in the API folder pull the sln to the top leve
      that is done and  add thigns to add project solution
      then the folder of the project that you want 
      ref the csproj file if it works locally commit nad work.
      bucket it larger than expected root of git repo
      runnign things that ain't funcitonal
      even though it is deployed our local js is from local host and such.
      turn on locally it is interisting.
      developing things is hard and such.
      update to other urls form azure but not including the messages and slash.
      now when you try to laod it we get something els
      we have made network requests to the API with infinate looop and URLS just doing it is their for the points.
      so late if you weren't in the account trouble things is interisting
      document to show up latter write reports that we are learnign no presentation
      presentation is not too crazy ut then we are interisting
      APriel going through showing things slideshow presentatoin and code go over a lot of things
      go over how you ment thre rubric items in final project.
      not part of presentations is in it 
      at the end you will have to have things work.
      slides and browser demo and 5-8 minutes is three or four slides demonstrate it and paragraph of code that your proud of and different parts
